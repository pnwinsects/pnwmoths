# PNW Moths Static Site

## Current State: v1.4 Shipped 2026-04-22

All v1.4 goals delivered: images on bunny.net CDN, LFS removed from history, build pipeline clean, full legacy dataset migrated. Site live on GitHub Pages with 1,348 species and 85,933 occurrence records.

## What This Is

A proof-of-concept reconstruction of pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu as a fully static site. Built with Eleventy, flat files (CSV + DuckDB/Parquet, Markdown), Vite for client-side JavaScript, and Lit web components. The site matches pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu visually (cream background, black header/footer, moth-strip banner, Google Fonts) and has a clean, tested build pipeline with 37 automated tests across the data pipeline and validation scripts.

## Core Value

Prove that a static build pipeline can replace a Django/CMS stack for a data-heavy natural history site — and that non-technical maintainers can keep it running.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Species list stored in CSV; Eleventy builds pages from flat-file source data — v1.0
- ✓ Per-species Parquet files generated from CSV at build time and deployed alongside HTML — v1.0
- ✓ DuckDB-based build pipeline: CSV → Parquet with pre-flight validation and post-import integrity checks — v1.0
- ✓ Eleventy generates ~700 species pages from a single pagination template — v1.0
- ✓ Each species page includes taxonomy, prose (from per-species Markdown), photos with credit, and similar species links — v1.0
- ✓ Browse pages: all-species grouped by family/genus, per-genus listing, site-wide navigation — v1.0
- ✓ Leaflet occurrence map, phenology chart, state/type/year filters, image slideshow — all as Lit web components loading Parquet asynchronously — v1.0
- ✓ Graceful JS-off degradation: taxonomy, prose, and photos visible as static HTML — v1.0
- ✓ Pagefind static search indexes species pages; excludes occurrence data — v1.0
- ✓ Glossary terms rendered alphabetically from CSV — v1.0
- ✓ Post-build link checker, page weight validator, data integrity validator — v1.0
- ✓ GitHub Actions CI/CD (deploy + PR check); Docker build environment — v1.0
- ✓ LLM-actionable `_instructions/` files for non-technical maintainers — v1.0
- ✓ Vite bundles client-side JS for interactive features — v1.0
- ✓ Site visual identity matches pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu (cream background, black header/footer, moth-strip banner, Google Fonts) — v1.1

- ✓ Site live on GitHub Pages with full production data — v1.4

### Active

- [ ] Eleventy build time verified under 5 minutes on GitHub Actions (MAINT-03 — requires live CI observation)
- [ ] Enable WebP conversion on bunny.net Optimizer (serving JPEG currently; toggle in Pull Zone → Optimizer → WebP conversion)

### Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Admin / editing UI | Editing done in flat files; UX to validate later |
| Zoomify deep-zoom viewer | Complex legacy feature; replaced by lightbox in v1 |
| Lucid key integration | External tool, not part of static site pipeline |
| User submissions / community ID | iNaturalist handles this; adds server infrastructure |
| Server-side search | No server; Pagefind provides static equivalent |
| Real-time data | All data is build-time; live observation feeds out of scope |
| Multi-site support | Original app supported multiple insect sites; this PoC is pnwmoths only |
| Photographic plates page | Deferred to v2 (PLAT-01, PLAT-02) |
| Advanced filtering (collector, elevation, date range) | Deferred to v2 (FILT-01, FILT-02) |
| Glossary term highlighting in prose | Deferred to v2 (GLOS-02) |
| Django URL redirects | Requires Netlify/Cloudflare; deferred to v2 (SEO-01) |

## Context

**v1.2 shipped:** 2026-04-18 — 7 phases total, 15 plans, 37 tests passing
**v1.3 shipped:** 2026-04-20 — 12 phases total (Phases 8–12), all 12 requirements verified; 58 tests passing
**v1.4 shipped:** 2026-04-22 — 17 phases total (Phases 13–17); 72/72 tests passing; 1,364 species pages; images on bunny.net CDN; LFS removed; full production dataset live

**Tech stack:**
- Eleventy 3.x (SSG), Vite (JS bundling), DuckDB (build-time queries), Parquet + hyparquet (client-side occurrence data)
- Lit web components, Leaflet (map), Pagefind (static search), Pico CSS (base styles)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Docker (reproducible build environment), lychee (link checker)

**Known tech debt (carry forward):**
- MAINT-03: build time under 5 min unverified — requires live CI observation
- No automated visual regression tests for the site's visual identity
- Code review WR-01–03: test cleanup paths could be more robust (warnings, non-blocking)
- WR-01 (migrate-species): similar_species links silently dropped for record-only species (slug resolution gap)
- WR-02 (migrate-species): safeSpecies sanitization logic duplicated in two loops (maintenance hazard)
- WebP not yet active on bunny.net Optimizer — currently serving JPEG

**Key data entities:**
- `Species` — genus, species, common name, NOC ID, authority, similar species links
- `SpeciesRecord` — occurrence data: lat/long, state, county, locality, elevation, date, collector, collection, record type
- `SpeciesImage` — photos per species with photographer credit, ordering weight
- `GlossaryWord` — glossary with optional images

## Constraints

- **Hosting**: Must deploy as pure static files — no server, no database at runtime
- **Images**: Image assets served from bunny.net CDN; Git LFS removed in v1.4
- **Maintainability**: Non-technical contributors must be able to edit species data and add records without running a build locally (or with minimal tooling)
- **Tech stack**: Eleventy (SSG), Vite (JS bundling), flat files for data storage — start here, change only with reason

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Eleventy over Hugo/Astro | Familiar to user, JS ecosystem, flexible data pipelines | ✓ Good — pagination and data files worked smoothly |
| Flat files over headless CMS | Cheap, Git-native, no external services, LLM-editable | ✓ Good — _instructions/ pattern validated |
| Pagefind for static search | No server required; runs at build time; handles 700+ pages well | ✓ Good — search works; occurrence data correctly excluded |
| DuckDB over SQLite for build-time queries | 100k+ occurrence records; better analytical query performance | ✓ Good — `@duckdb/node-api` works; use `.getRowObjectsJS()` and `closeSync()` |
| Parquet + hyparquet for client-side occurrence data | Async loading avoids large inline JSON payloads; columnar compression efficient | ✓ Good — requires Snappy compression (not ZSTD); use `COMPRESSION snappy` in DuckDB export |
| Lit for client-side components | Lightweight web components standard; lower churn than framework alternatives | ✓ Good — light DOM required for Leaflet; CSS custom properties unavailable in Canvas 2D |
| Git LFS for image assets | Keeps images in repo without bloating git history | ✗ Replaced — bunny.net CDN; LFS purged from all history via filter-repo (v1.4) |
| CDN_BASE_URL as public constant (not env var) | URL is intentionally public; no secret needed; simpler for non-technical maintainers | ✓ Good — eliminates dotenv machinery; hard-coded in eleventy.config.js (v1.4) |
| Clone from LOCAL repo for LFS history rewrite | Local working copy had 60+ unpushed commits; cloning from GitHub would have lost Phase 13/14 work | ✓ Good — critical pattern for force-push workflows with ahead-of-remote local commits (v1.4) |
| Module-level CDN constant in web components (not Lit property) | CDN URL is static; no need for reactive property; simpler and avoids attribute plumbing | ✓ Good — CDN_BASE_URL in pnwm-taxon-browser.js as module-level const (v1.4) |
| Streaming readline for large SQL dump parsing | 634 MB dump exceeds Node.js 512 MB string-length limit; createReadStream + readline is safe equivalent | ✓ Good — migrate-species.js handles full dump without memory crash (v1.4) |
| DB genus+species slug for records.csv | Image-derived slugs differ from DB slugs for ~326 reclassified species; build-data.js JOIN uses lower(genus\|\|'-'\|\|species) | ✓ Good — records correctly join to species in full dataset (v1.4) |
| Docker for build environment | Reproducible builds locally and in CI | ✓ Good — Docker cold-start issue resolved; anonymous volume protects node_modules |
| Pico CSS design token overrides via theme.css | No Pico source modification; clean separation; one file controls all brand tokens | ✓ Good — applied to all ~700 pages via single base.njk link |
| Post-Vite asset copy in scripts/copy-images.js | eleventy-plugin-vite wipes _site/ during build; passthrough copies don't survive Vite's output directory rename | ✓ Good — extends existing copy-images.js pattern cleanly |
| species_slug as foreign key in images.csv and records.csv | Slug is stable, human-readable, and matches URL structure; id is an implementation detail | ✓ Good — slug-keyed CSVs are easier for non-technical contributors to edit |
| JSON over Parquet for species-states.json | At 700 species × ~6 states (~4,200 pairs, ~20–30 KB), hyparquet overhead not justified | ✓ Good — simple fetch + parse, no extra dependency |
| Light DOM for Lit accordion (`createRenderRoot() { return this; }`) | Pico CSS element selectors don't penetrate shadow DOM; must decide at creation, not retrofit | ✓ Good — Pico styles apply correctly; CSS custom properties unavailable in Canvas 2D (pre-existing constraint) |
| DuckDB `nullstr = ''` on read_csv for species.csv | Blank `subfamily` must arrive as null, not empty string, to avoid silent grouping failures | ✓ Good — null-coercion works correctly; required on both read_csv calls |
| Taxonomy JSON as `<script type="application/json" id="taxon-data">` sibling | `data-taxonomy` attribute causes HTML entity encoding of JSON; separate script tag avoids this | ✓ Good — `| safe` on tojson output also required in template |
| Raw `/images/...` paths in templates (not `| url` filter) | Vite HTML transformer double-prefixes asset URLs when Eleventy `| url` filter has already added pathPrefix | ✓ Good — let Vite add base prefix; don't pre-process with `| url` |
